# MRSS 2025 Reinforcement Learning Tutorial

This code contains code for showing reinforcement learning code and is based on another [tutorial](https://github.com/milarobotlearningcourse/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/ppo_continuous_action.py)

It was tested with python=3.10


You need the following

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install gymnasium[mujoco]
```


# Exercises 1 (Implement PPO)
This should run the code once you implement the missing details
```
python ppo_continuous_action.py --env_id HalfCheetah-v4 --num_envs 8 
```
# Exercise 2 (Implement Forward Model)

This should run the code once you implement the missing details

```
python ppo_continuous_action_model.py --env_id HalfCheetah-v4 --num_envs 8 
```
